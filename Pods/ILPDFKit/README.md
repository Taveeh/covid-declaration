> A simple, minimalist toolkit for filling out PDF forms, and extracting PDF data in iOS, that extends *WKWebView* and the *CoreGraphics PDF C API*.

## Features

- [x] Parse and analyze PDF documents with easy API.
- [x] Fill out and save PDF AcroForms to a flat non-editable PDF.
- [x] Handle text, button and combo fields.
- [x] Easy introspection using PDFDocument, PDFPage, PDFDictionary and PDFArray.
- [x] Rapidly, parse, extract and analyze PDF document structure, data and properties.
- [ ] Handle signature fields.
- [ ] Save AcroForm values to the original, editable PDF.
- [ ] Comprehensive Unit and Integration Test Coverage
- [ ] [Swift Documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ILPDFKit)

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 9.1+
- Swift 4.0+

## Installation

### Cocoapods
 
```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod ILPDFKit
end  
```

Then, run the following command:
`pod install`
 
### Carthage

To integrate ILPDFKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "derekblair/ILPDFKit"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `ILPDFKit.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Quick Start

 The quickest way to get started with ILPDFKit is to take a look at the included sample app. For example, to view a PDF form resource named 'test.pdf' you can do the following: 
 
 
```swift
let document = ILPDFDocument(resource:"myPDF")
// Manually set a form value
document.forms.setValue("Derek", forFormWithName: "Contacts.FirstName")
// Save via a static PDF.
let flatPDF = document.savedStaticPDFData()
```

## PDF Support 

ILPDFKit currently supports a narrow range of PDF versions and is not suitable for a production app that needs to save general PDF files from versions 1.3 to 1.7
  
 PDF features that cause issues with saving include:
  
  1. Linearized PDF files (Linearization is broken after save. File will open correctly using WKWebView, Preview, and Chrome but Adobe reader fails)
  
  2. Object Streams (This library can not currently save fields stored in object streams, introduced in PDF 1.5 , files that use object streams are sometimes referred to as compressed files as object streams can compress PDF objects in the file).
  
  
## Usage

### Filling Out Forms

```swift
pdfViewController = ILPDFViewController(resource:"test.pdf")
window.rootViewController = pdfViewController
// Have fun filling out the form.
```

### Getting/Setting Form Values Explicitly

```swift
for form in pdfViewController.document.forms {
	// Get
	let formValue = form.value;
	let formName = form.name; // Fully qualified field name.
	// Set
	form.value = "foo";
	
	// If the form is visible on screen it will updated automatically.
	// You can access the actual associated widget annotation view as below.
	// let widgetView = form.associatedWidget()
}
```


### Custom Styling of Form Fields 


All fields are easily custom styled.
